          "answer": `I’m running for Council because I have had two years on the Council to learn, and I now have a better view of what needs to be done to
improve governance of the City and accountability to our citizens. I hope to win a 4-year seat so I can make a difference in the Council
and in the City. I will bring a practical, common-sense approach to solving the problems of this community. In addition, my
entrepreneurial background gives me that kind of mindset to opportunities within the city, whether it be economic, environmental,
housing, transportation, or the arts.

My top 3 priorities for the coming term are a) housing b) governance and accountability; c) environmental initiatives, based on results of
municipalization vote and the potential need to go a different direction.

How I am qualified: I have spent the past 2 years on Council, and I’ve learned a lot about City operations, budget, and processes. I have
spent many years in the business world, managing large high-tech sales and service organizations. I have had to make difficult
decisions, manage large teams and large budgets. I am a proven leader and manager, and I have managed and led change. I have also
served on non-profit boards locally and co-founded a company and have expertise in housing and the arts. Please find more information

          "answer": `Boulder must continue to evolve. We need to crowd source our wisdom, which will require new outreach methods – insisting upon attendance at public hearings will not suffice. Council members should be approachable and they should have well-established relationships with a diverse mix of community members, through extensive and varied types of community service. http://byrneforcouncil.com/bio/

It also helps to have relevant experience and expertise. I started in Boulder as an assistant city attorney (municipal prosecutor, zoning, planning, OS/RE), then worked for Colorado Ski Country USA (CSCUSA), where I helped develop strategies to more effectively address environmental and resort town challenges like those facing Boulder today.

When I left CSCUSA in 1994, I was appointed by Will Fleissig to be the community representative on the North Boulder Subcommunity Plan Steering Committee, where I was appointed one of three Co-Chairs. In that role, I helped draft the principles of neighborhood primary self-sufficiency that continue to guide NoBo's development.

Council is not just a "planning" body, however. Nor should it be a management team. As an all-volunteer group, Council should be a policy-making board of directors that guides, but does not implement day-to-day delivery of key city services (police, fire, transportation, water, wastewater, libraries, senior centers and parks & rec, etc.)

Fiscal accountability is critical, yet the City budget is full of earmarked funds that may not be spent to achieve other purposes. Over time, we must restore budget discipline, so that we do not need to ask the citizens to pass bi-annual referenda to cover ordinary expenses. We should prioritize and allocate of general fund revenues derived from more dependable revenue streams.

Government needs to know its limitations. As a former city prosecutor, I believe we should not pass an ordinance simply to prohibit every behavior we want to discourage. Education and the use of positive incentives can be even more effective. http://byrneforcouncil.com/category/justice-system/

Finally, it is time for Boulder to recognize that many of its most demanding challenges (workforce housing, transportation, access to parks and open space, social service delivery, etc.) cannot be met without developing more effective regional solutions in partnership with other communities in our interdependent regional economy. http://byrneforcouncil.com/1999/10/23/fair-effective-and-sustainable-growth-management-future-human-settlement-patterns-in-the-american-west/

My three top priorities are:<br/>
1. Fiscal Accountability<br/>
2. Neighborhood and Regional outreach<br/>
3. Fostering more hope and less fear concerning Boulder's future<br/>
4. Civil Discourse

Qualifications: Experience & Expertise

I've lived in Boulder for 36 years, raising a family, working, playing and volunteering with residents from all walks of life. My first job was assistant city attorney for Boulder. Then I worked for the ski resort industry (mentioned above). I've served on nearly a dozen community boards and committees, ranging from a school improvement team, to several business groups, a church building committee, chairing many of them. I will bring all that I've learned as a citizen engaged in most of the City's planning initiatives since 1990, and as an attorney representing homeowners with dreams (some realized, some not - all frustrated by the City's processes), to one of the nine seats on Council.`

          "answer": `Boulder is changing and change is hard for almost all of us. We can’t wish our way back to some golden era of Boulder’s past. We need
leadership to guide us to better results – now. I am:
• Practical and driven by data.
• Focused on positive outcomes that serve the greatest good.
• Bold and compassionate.

My interest and qualifications come from my 40 years of living in Boulder where we raised two children, have two grandchildren, and
three elderly parents. These deep roots have me invested in the community from the young to the old and from the business community
to progressive social causes.

I have a 30 year track record of building a successful business that brings US component manufacturers and US OEMs together in
negotiated win/win contracts. This success is due to my abilities to listen carefully and evaluate the needs and goals of multiple parties.

Priorities:

Transportation:

Drive if you must, bike, bus or walk if you can. Alternative transport should be seen as helpful, not scorned. I support the Complete
Streets Program and complete cycling infrastructure. The Folsom experiment failed, but that should not doom the whole program. Let’s
acknowledge lessons learned, correct course, and carry on.
RTD is not a partner in solving our daily transportation problems of in/out commuting. A partnership between the city and major
employers should be explored to create new commuting routes separate from RTD. Businesses need to contribute. I will work for:
• Citywide EcoPasses.
• Transit systems that are responsive to our needs vs. the RTD agenda.
• A convenient and frequent system that accommodates in/out commuters to major
employment centers.
• Working with businesses on all of the above.
Housing Affordability—I support:
• A regional housing plan that shares the burden and benefit with our neighboring communities and includes both public and private
developers.
• The work of Boulder Housing Partners (City of Boulder Housing Authority) to increase the number of permanently affordable units in
the city.
• Gentle in-fill in allowing greater flexibility by homeowners to build small accessory units, alley houses, mother-in-law apartments, etc.—
that allows folks to stay in their homes longer and more affordably.
• Increased density in areas along transit corridors and in mixed commercial districts.
• Adjustment our parking requirements. We accommodate cars, seemingly endlessly, while not accommodating people who use public
and non-automotive transportation.

Meeting our carbon goals:

The municipalization project is changing rapidly. My key stated point has beeen that we need to keep our eye on cost effective carbon
reduction – now. Xcel’s latest efforts to increase renewables and decrease coal are laudable. I believe in rewarding good deeds. It is
regrettable that the vote on the occupation tax will be seen as a deciding factor on the muni because one path forward is to support the
tax and simultaneously end the muni effort while redirecting those funds to solar incentives and other worthy projects. For example, the
city could create new subsidies for Smartregs. (Initial incentives were exhausted early in the program).`

          "answer": `I am running for City Council because engaging with my community and finding solutions to challenges that face us all is my passion.
Now - more than ever - Boulder needs passionate, experienced, diverse leaders to help lead the way on housing, our energy future,
transportation, open space, social justice issues, and business support.

I am the mother of two young boys, Ryder and Treker, both of whom help inform my vision for the future of our community. I moved to
Boulder 11 years ago after completing my degree in Political Science at The College of William & Mary. I quickly fell in love with
Boulder's natural beauty, creative spirit and commitment to the environment. My first year here I taught civics at The Watershed School
where I engaged with my students in community issues and volunteered with Meals on Wheels. Later, I joined the Board of New Era
Colorado where I served for five years. Through New Era I helped launch a campaign to reduce disposable bags. That campaign
resulted in our bag fee ordinance, which has prevented thousands of bags from entering our landfill.

I am currently the Vice Chair of the City of Boulder Board of Zoning Adjustments and serve on the board of Thistle Communities, a
nonprofit dedicated to bringing more affordable housing to Boulder. For the last few years I have worked as an advocate for our mobile
home communities, helping save dozens of families from eviction, and ultimately working with state legislators to help pass a bill to save
mobile homes from tax lien investors.

I participated in the Chamber of Commerce leadership program, have served on multiple housing working groups, and have been
named one of the top "40 under Forty young professionals who are shaping the future of the Boulder Valley" by BizWest.

In addition to the passion, commitment, and leadership that I bring to the table, I ask that you consider the following:<br/>
* I am openly gay. Boulder has not had an openly LGBTQ City Councilperson in more than four decades. With the rise on anti-LGBTQ
sentiment across the country, representation for this community is more significant than ever.<br/>
* I have young children. A large portion of Boulder residents are families and it is important to represent their voices on Council.<br/>
* I am 36 years old. More than 50% of Boulder residents are between the ages of 25 and 43, and we do not have a single council
member representing that demographic.<br/>
* I am a real estate professional. With housing and development as two of our most important issues to tackle in the coming years, it is
important to have someone on council who understands these issues from a first hand perspective.<br/>

My top two priorities as a Councilwoman will be: 1. Work to achieve more affordable and accessible housing; 2. Continue to work on our
energy future to reduce carbon emissions as quickly as possible. Additionally, I am passionate about tackling homelessness, food
insecurity, and other social justice issues that face our community.`

With Boulder’s high housing prices, many of my peers have made the hard choice to purchase homes and start families elsewhere. But Boulder is my community, and I plan to stay here to help lead us through these challenges. I want to be known as someone who worked on all these challenges — made strong progress on climate change, while growing the economy, and making sure we’re meeting the housing and transportation needs of our community.

Over the last seven years I have become more and more involved in our community:
- I’m an economist and have worked as a project and product manager for technology companies in the Boulder area
- I helped create a connected toy startup helped kids learn engineering
- analyzed B-cycle bike sharing system usage to understand how a system of bikes help people get around Boulder
- delivered an Ignite Boulder talk on creative housing options in the city
- completed the 2015 Ironman Boulder
- served on committees for Community Cycles and Better Boulder, worked with the Boulder Community Housing Association
- President of Newland Court Condo Association to successfully lead homeowners through a difficult restoration
- I currently chair the City of Boulder Landmarks Board.`

          "answer": `I am running for City Council so that I can provide a voice for groups that are overlooked in Boulder. Most young and working class people do not have the time to get involved in local government because they are working just to remain a part of the community. They need a representative who is part of this community and struggles with the same issues they have.

My top three priorities are all based on reducing the growing inequality in Boulder. First, improving representation for more of the community. Our campaign wants to encourage more young and working class people to get involved with the process by registering to vote and encouraging others to run for local government positions. We want to build a legacy of Boulderites who will consider community involvement an important part of their lives, and pass that commitment to others.

Second, we will continue encouraging the expansion of our Permanently Affordable Homes Program, with the inclusion of permanently affordable middle income housing. Home ownership is the keystone of the American Dream and the best opportunity to help people both feel like part of their community and improve their life. While renting allows for flexibility in a market that is friendly to exploring different jobs, settling into a home is where the long term benefits for our community really occur. Doing everything we can to get more people to live where they work will not only improve our community, but keep Boulder a diverse place full of different ideas.

Finally, I intend to be a check on our budget to make sure tax dollars are going toward programs that will benefit the most people, not the loudest group in the room. Governing is not an easy task, especially in a place like Boulder where people are proud of their ideals and are not afraid to show it. We should make sure our sights are set on the best programs and expenditures that will reduce the burden on the average Boulder citizen should take priority. As an average citizen myself who is beholden to no group I think I’m in a unique position to take on our problems with a fresh perspective while keeping the underrepresented as my driving motivation.

My public service qualifications are not as vast as many of my fellow candidates, but that is because my time has been spent working to remain a citizen of Boulder. Having two jobs since college was a requirement to keep up with housing costs. While this has kept me from participating in local government given me firm ties to the community. My years as spent at CU as a student, coaching rowing at Boulder Reservoir, and working in the service industry has engrained me in parts of the community most candidates are not familiar with. Now I am established enough that I can take on the task of representing the young and working class communities that I have been a part of for the last decade.`

          "answer": `I am running for boulder city council because as a young father and a husband I realize it’s important to put our Future First. It’s is our generation’s time to lead the change we envision for this world. The Polarization we see at the national and state level is not exciting our generation to be a part of that process and lead that change. Therefore it’s hard for us to take ownership of building a community or future for our children and grandchildren. I intend to change that and bring a moderating and stabilizing force in our local government to keep the pendulum from swinging to far in any one direction. Boulder seems to be at a crossroad that sounds eerily similar to that of the National one, do we want to be an inclusive community that creates opportunities for current and future generations, or do we want to close the gates behind us and limit the who gets to have opportunity for success? My top three priorities are Effective Governance, Affordable Housing and Energy. I view Effective Governance as the foundation from which we measure our success or failure in reaching the goals we set for the array of issues we face in our community. We are not getting the most out of our elected officials and thus we are falling short on many of the goals we’ve set. This is less a critique of the people on council and more of the system they’re embedded within. I will bring a “quality over quantity” approach to Council and use evidence-based decision making to truly deliver on our goals. The second priority is Affordable Housing. The lack of effective governance is limiting our success in our affordable housing programs. We are seeing the decline of the young working family. Boulder has done well in building truly affordable housing but has done little to provide middle-income housing. We need a diversity of housing to offer an economic ladder for these young working families. My third priority is Energy. Here too, effective governance has made it harder for Boulder to reach its climate goals. Boulder has become distracted by our municipal utility efforts, and we have missed and continue to not pursue a variety of solutions that get us to our renewable energy and greenhouse gas emission goals. Slowing and reversing the impacts of climate change will define this generation and others to follow. We must put all options on the table and be willing to explore solutions large and small to get us to our goals. My scientific background and experience make me uniquely qualified to lead Boulder through the challenges of tomorrow. I live my life as a steward of my community and environment. This stewardship is epitomized by my commitment to putting our Future First.`

          "answer": `I’m running for City Council because I care about Boulder – the place where I was born and raised. I’m running because I believe better solutions need to be crafted, that can bring our community together.
I represent a fresh perspective – as a younger candidate, as a small business owner, as a Boulder native, as an affordable housing alumnus who saved enough money to buy a home in the City of Boulder section of Gunbarrel, and as a volunteer firefighter who understands the needs of our first responder and service community.

I’ve lived in Boulder virtually all my life, and have listened to people’s concerns for my entire adult life. I’ve basically served a “34 year internship” here, and with many deep, experienced observations into Boulder issues, I’m ready to serve on Council.

My top three priorities are:

a. Protecting affordability, in better ways that ensure that:
◦ Boulder stays affordable for lower and middle income residents.
◦ and encourages more affordable housing to be built onsite at new housing developments.
◦ and ensures that new commercial growth helps fund housing for its workers.

b. Environmental stewardship, and addressing climate change. Boulder isn’t the wonderful place it is by accident. It’s because of concerted, committed efforts by people who envisioned a community that would choose greenbelts over sprawl, and a city whose evolution would be characterized by careful planning documents like the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan, rather than chaotic growth.
Addressing climate change is extremely important. It’s the single greatest threat to our survival, besides nuclear war. Accordingly, I support the City’s Climate Action Plan, and major reductions in carbon emissions from transportation, energy production, and buildings (commercial, industrial, and residential).

c. Responsible Growth and Development that:
◦ Provides tangible, defined, specific community benefit.
◦ and carries with it mitigation for increased impacts such as traffic.
◦ and adequately pays for the increased City infrastructure required to serve it.
◦ and is sensitive to its surroundings.

I’m qualified to represent the residents of Boulder in several important ways:

First, I’ve demonstrated significant leadership in the Sugarloaf Fire Protection District. I’m one signature away from becoming a Squad Boss, which will make me the highest ranking woman on the Wildland Fire Crew. In this effort, I’ve completed extensive leadership training. I’m endorsed by Fire Chiefs and Paramedics, who recognize my leadership. If I can lead well in these high intensity situations – as I have, when fires are raging and people’s lives are at stake – I can lead in City government as well.

Second, I straddle many worlds that don’t often intersect in Boulder. This puts me in an excellent position to facilitate the elusive solutions we really need now. I know that with the talents, skills, and education of the people of Boulder, we can come up with more win-win solutions that work for everyone.

We need to make our streets and civic spaces safer, we need innovative transportation solutions to move people more efficiently from Point A to Point B, and we need to sustain the vitality of our economy while retaining our sense of community.

My key priorities as a City Councilmember reflect the above values. Specifically, I will bring a progressive voice to Council to make our neighborhood streets and civic spaces safer, to promote innovative transportation solutions with wider accessibility so we can reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions, and advance our economy through smart growth and middle-income housing strategies. As demonstrated through my professional career and volunteer public service roles, I have the experience, creativity and commitment to achieve these goals and the passion to make Boulder an even better place.

government on one hand; and on the other hand, big money and dwindling trust in government.
My top three priorities are affordability, climate change, and early citizen involvement in decision making processes.
The most important issue to me is that of community. I have a track record of listening to and working with Boulder's citizens, including
the university's students, staff, and faculty. If elected, I'll carry that strong commitment into office and, to start, will work diligently to put
the Public Participation Working Group's recommendations into practice. I think our council needs to listen better to the community
about issues from affordability to climate change to community participation in government.

How am I qualified to serve? I've made it my life's work to study and implement good governance. I'll always remember that I represent
the people first. I ran for the city council in 1985 to return city government to the citizens and to preserve Boulder's special qualities. I'm
running again because I think my years of experience in elected office and community service have prepared me to help us achieve our
shared vision for Boulder. I was a Boulder City Council member 1986-1989; a Gates Scholar to the Kennedy School of Government,
1987; steering committee for Boulder's Campaign Finance Reform initiative, 1999; and served on the CU Board of Regents 2003-2009.`

- Maintaining a healthy business environment for the long term;
- Achieving aggressive carbon emissions reductions; and
- Supporting a sustainable community that actively cares for those in need.

I’m a founder of a Boulder–based clean energy technology company. As a job creator and innovator, I understand the world of Boulder’s start-up businesses. Our entrepreneurial culture is important to the community and should be nourished by the public sector. The largest of local businesses create economic stability and enable spin-offs and startups to innovate and grow. For ten years prior to starting my own business, I worked as a researcher at the University of Colorado. I understand first-hand the significant contributions that the university, Federal labs and the scientific community make to the local economy. As a Council member, I’ve bolstered and supported these important sectors.

I served on Boulder’s Planning Board in 2012, before being elected to Council in 2013. I deeply understand local land use issues and the how to effectively regulate growth and development in our community. With the support of fellow Council members and staff, I’ve helped implement some of the nation’s best commercial energy codes; rolled out commercial recycling and composting regulations; and supported adoption of some of the most energy-efficient new building codes in the country. In addition, the City organization has made great progress in reducing its own carbon emissions over the last four years while we’ve moved forward on exploring a local municipal electric utility.

I’ve consistently lobbied for increasing City support of our critical local nonprofits. How different our community would be without EFFA, Bridge House, VIA, Mental Health Partners, and many other community service organizations, including the City affordable housing and EXPAND programs. I support policies and organizations that achieve housing access and supply, while retaining a low-rise, compact city character.

Given the unfortunate state of the nation’s current leadership and political polarization, I believe local government should take even more progressive action. I am convinced that Boulder, of all places in the United States, has the ability to lead through environmentally sound initiatives, including a local clean electric utility, additional resilience programs such as community gathering places during crises, and a continuing focus on energy efficiency. At the same time, Boulder needs to lead the way in minimizing the impacts of natural gas, both in its extraction and in its use.
Since 2008, my wife Maggie and I have lived in the Whittier area.  In this eminently walkable neighborhood, there is diversity among residents and property types, a situation that is more and more challenging to preserve in the face of rapidly escalating home prices. Maintaining a range of housing options for Boulder residents is a priority for me, and I will fight for it if elected.`

One potential method could be to form 3 districts, with 2 members elected from each district and 3 at large members.

Deftly, and efficiently, facilitating such meetings is a very particular skill. I’m not sure if this would be obvious in an election. To the extent that a given Council needs to function under a Mayor and Pro Tem, it makes some sense for Council to choose who they feel can best lead their meetings.

Similarly, electing Council members by district has some appeal. Yet it’s not guaranteed that certain districts would have more than one person running for Council (if that).  At that point, it’d actually be less democratic if certain districts are represented by candidates who were uncontested.`

controlled our height limits, but we have since allowed zoning laws to decrease density and allow for larger homes on bigger pieces of
land. We should take environmental issues more serious regarding the built environment, allowing for light in-fill (like ADU’s, duplexes,
triplexes, split lots), which will allow more people to bike, walk, and take the bus. We should build more mixed use and higher density
developments on our major transit roads like Arapahoe and Broadway, and we should encourage smaller living quarters like micro-units.
We need to do more education about the original strategy of a “dense urban core” and get more buy-in to the concept of density.

I support both public and private solutions to housing. With skyrocketing land values, we should buy existing properties or land, and we
should create incentives for building of affordable housing. Incentives can include faster approval cycles and waiving of fees for 100%
affordable projects.`

Land costs, procedural delays, and complicated public policy trade-offs (units/acre, inclusionary housing and other development fees, on-site open space, parking, easement dedications, etc.) that are hard-wired into the Code drive up costs. The private sector won't build projects that don't pencil, and we shouldn't expect them to do so.  We can drag them kicking and screaming towards meeting our goals, but if they aren't still with us when we're done, our already too expensive housing will become even more so.

Mixed use density in the right place (transit corridors and nodes) and for the right reasons (to create more complete neighborhoods that better serve the day-to-day needs of residents (ask them) is part of the answer. Auto-dependent planning is a failed experiment. 65,000 in-commuters is one of its symptoms. Every new dwelling unit we build in Boulder should appeal to one of our in-commuters. They're already here. We must keep trying to build them homes. To do nothing leaves us where we are today, with personal wealth as Boulder's "sorting hat." This has its own environmental, economic, and cultural consequences, none of them anything to be proud of.

Our private sector is not the enemy in this fight. We must work creatively with them as full partners to meet the challenge. We should establish a community land trust with robust incentives (property tax relief, public recognition, etc.) supporting voluntary contribution of land and, more importantly, existing homes into the trust. Real estate transfer taxes (RETT) should be evaluated to determine whether they will help, and if so, whether Boulder's voters will vote to impose them.

Finally, the City's support of accessory dwelling units and cooperative housing should be increased, and the ability to create them, particularly with respect to ADUs, should be expanded. For example, location of ADUs in detached structures in the RL-1 zone district should be allowed, parking requirements along transit corridors should be reduced, and the geographic limits on them should be lifted. Owner occupancy solves many problems, and ADUs have proved their value, reducing the negative impacts of such "density" by using structures and empty bedrooms that are already in place. They will also help young couples and seniors be able to afford to live in and stay in Boulder.`

There are undoubtedly other areas of Boulder that support increased density, but I would look to involve residents of various parts of Boulder, to answer this question.

One step I think will help in this area is a focus on housing incentives for some of our commercial zones in those areas.  This includes density bonuses that make it feasible to develop a more affordable mix of units.  I also think we can explore the purchase of our existing housing stock to avoid expensive remodels that only add the price of single-family homes. Another option is to expand the opportunity to add alternative dwelling units (ADUs), otherwise known as “granny-flats,” to existing single family residents. At the same time, we need to be sensitive to neighborhood concerns about higher density uses.

In many ways, my opinion has not changed since we began our effort, but city expenditures have continued and even accelerated with no end in sight.

I'm no fan of the way Xcel has conducted itself during this prolonged struggle, either. There should have been a way to work together to reduce Boulder's carbon footprint, but Xcel hasn't offered a reasonable one yet.

incentives for solar systems.

Because the measure is worded narrowly, supporting the muni only, I predict it will be defeated. If defeated, we will lose a year minimum

We should also look for opportunities to balance the load on our system or build more sustainable paths for heavily-used trails (the recent improvements at Chautauqua is a good example of a trail built for very use). Any night closures must be targeted, need strong justification, and be minimally restrictive (i.e. limited to overnight hours).`

A circumstance that occurs to me is the intermittent Flatirons climbing closure I mentioned in Question 9. That intermittent closure has served for decades as a workable, balanced policy – one that is widely accepted by the recreationist community.

To the extent that we fail to maintain trails and proper access facilities, we risk increased damage to our lands as people and animals move off-trail.

As I have learned through my own experiences with Open Space, I believe that facilitating responsible usage encourages greater preservation, and that we have an obligation as a community to discuss usage levels and appropriate levels of maintenance. As pressures from outside visitors grow, I believe we must take into account mass transportation and parking policies that support our goals for Open Space, as we did for Chautauqua and the pilot program to provide free busing.

a sound approach based on best practices. It will enable us to provide a strong safety net for those in need and enhance the overall
quality of life for all residents in our community.

On Council, I will work to 1) maximize efficiency and effectiveness of city resources in reducing homelessness and 2) encourage staff to
play a leadership role in crafting regional solutions so governmental entities throughout the county are doing their part. Let’s make sure
that whatever we do, we make the situation in Boulder better.`

difficult making the first and last mile connections, and it takes too long to commute by bus. We should work on the first/last mile by
encouraging car-sharing services to be subsidized by businesses and electrify our buses by working with BVSD, CU, Via and RTD to
replace diesel buses with electric buses. We should down-size buses on local routes to smaller, more frequent options.
We should build more lanes on Arapahoe for today’s cars and encourage the use of EV’s by working with the Chamber and large
employers to put in charging stations. We should encourage CU to become car-free and encourage ride sharing with Lyft/Uber for
parents driving kids to school. We should build more density on Arapahoe to allow workers to live closer to their places of work in “15-

The routes laid out by RTD decades ago no longer serve Boulder well, and RTD has been singularly unresponsive when dealing with our last-mile challenges.

New transportation solutions (Uber, Lyft, self-driving vehicles, electric bikes, etc.) may help, but, until they do, Boulder should develop "capture zones" at the edge of town, build residential housing in non-residential zone districts, encourage ADUs, and work with neighborhoods to create village centers within residential enclaves.

streets, however I would like to be more sensitive about the locations we start with, the timing at which we implement it, and the
communication to the public. On roads that have been studied and identified as correct locations for “right-sizing,” we can begin to ease

•	Community wide Eco Passes.
•	Municipalize some elements of our bus system in order to deploy smaller, electric buses for “first and last mile,” that could integrate and interface with RTD.
•	I’d ensure that new multi modal transit centers like the one in North Boulder have adequate auto parking.  Doing so would increase mass transit ridership because many more North Boulder and north Foothills residents would use make the mode shift for 90% of their trip, if they could drive 10% of it, and park at the transit center.

I favor investments that expand multi-modal transportation options, such as community-wide EcoPass-type programs, additional bus-rapid-transit corridors, electric vehicles and charging stations, and first- and final-mile connections to incentivize mass transit that facilitate biking and pedestrian travel without creating additional pain for drivers.

And just a word about RTD: I have seen firsthand through my role as TAB Chair how difficult it is to work with them to improve our transportation services. I am very interested in partnering with other towns in the region on commuting solutions beyond our reliance on RTD. `
