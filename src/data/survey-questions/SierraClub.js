goals of clean energy and energy efficiency. I have championed smaller dwellings, in-fill, and creative ideas to to
address climate change through the building envelope, energy efficiency, and transportation.

My biggest environmental achievement is co-founding a company that makes tiny homes and structures from upcycled
shipping containers. Investing my own money and time, I have demonstrated my commitment to the
environment by a) recycling shipping containers that otherwise would become nature’s waste or melted down b)
building small c) building energy efficient structures. We have designed and received approval from the U.S. Forest
Service for a bike hut to be used in on a bike trail in Utah.

On a smaller scale, I have a very small, but important role as a volunteer OSMP Raptor Monitor. I help to monitor
peregrine falcons on a closure area south of Boulder. It’s the most rewarding thing I do.`

We organized and worked on many trail projects in the city, the county and on national forest and BLA land. I trained as a trail crew leader and led many of the aforementioned trail projects. In doing so, I learned much about how trails and trail design interplays with impacts of erosion from rain, snow and user behavior.

In the mid-2000's, I became involved in the carsharing movement. I was appointed to the board of eGo CarShare which I served on for 3 years. During that time, I worked with the organization's executive director to apply for its first Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality grant. eGo was awarded $190,000 which set the stage for the organization's growth from purely a small used car operation to one that now competes in the metro area with the big national for profit companies that have entered the arena.

In 2009, I joined the staff of Growing Gardens working on design and build of community gardens. After my employment I briefly served on the board. Through this experience I honed my personal gardening skills which have given me an appreciation for how soil and weather affects, on a micro basis, my ability to grow healthy edible plants. On a macro level, it has enabled me to notice, year to year, the variation in weather (and by extension, climate) and how it is affecting our ability as human beings to coax life sustaining food out of the earth.

I left the engineering profession about a decade ago because I became increasingly concerned about my participation in perpetuating the consumerist society that fuels our economy. Much of what we do as humans is simply not sustainable.

I believe that we need to change the language around climate change from “saving the planet” to “saving ourselves.” This anthropocene era that we are in follows 5 other extinctions of life on this planet. Yet, the planet has survived, will we?`

Social media is one of the most powerful tools to reach people and spread knowledge if done so effectively. A strong educational social media campaign could do more to help reach our goals at no additional environmental cost.

Second, I think it’s important to partner with CU more effectively to reduce waste. Students represent 30,000 residents of our community who are trying to get an education, and while surveying indicates we have a very environmentally considerate student body, the reality of each spring cleanout shows that there is room to improve. Establishing drop off sites throughout the city for hard to recycle items two times a year is a great way for both students and the whole community to get rid of items in an environmentally conscious way.

Which is another reason to municipalize. The transition to solar could occur more quickly because our municipal utility could move more quickly to sever the ties to coal and natural gas than a regulated monopoly.

Section 176 of the charter enumerates the purposes of Open Space. The third purpose is: “(c) Preservation of land for passive recreational use, such as hiking, photography or nature studies, and, if specifically designated, bicycling, horseback riding, or fishing;” I predict that this purpose will be the one that gathers most of the public and master planning process attention.

The questions this section raises for me are “How much recreational use?” “At what costs?” “Who pays?” Good stewardship will look to answer these questions. Costs should not be assessed only monetarily but also in terms of eco-systems services and impacts to flora and fauna.

We have created an asset in our city that both nurtures us and plagues us. Chautauqua currently receives more visitors than Rocky Mountain National Park, with the number of visitors at Mt. Sanitas close behind. This is good for our economy, but bad for the land and the flora and fauna which it nurtures. Add to the questions above the the following factors: climate change and fire risk, rise in homeless transients choosing to camp there, diminishing funding for Open Space and you have a wicked problem in formulating a broadly acceptable stewardship plan.

The community as a whole (including all visitors) will ultimately have to make sacrifices if we are to be truly good stewards of the land.`

The Master Plan should set forth criteria-based decision-making processes for determining which uses, if any, are appropriate for each type of area of Open Space. The different ecological types of land managed by OSMP are already well-categorized in other documents, and guidelines and criteria for uses in each type should be set forth, without making specific determinations of use within sites. Theories of management for the different area types should be laid out clearly. Management of uses should be spelled out explicitly, and every effort should be made to allow as many uses on trails as possible without causing appreciable degradation of the local ecological and habitat value of the land. Where user conflicts are noted, the plan should be creative in proposing strategies for managing uses, considering approaches such as alternating uses by schedule (temporal separation) and using use restrictions only when levels of use conflict are unacceptable, or when given uses are causing degradation of the habitat values.`

This very general question is difficult to answer in a general way except to describe principles to apply in case-by-case determinations.

The tensions inherent to the discussion of how much use, when and where are inherent in the purposes listed, which include passive recreation as well as preservation. A guiding principle for me is that OSMP habitat which shelters threatened or endangered species (both vegetation and wildlife) should be treated with the utmost care, and that in those areas, preservation values must be addressed first. In areas in which primarily more common species are found, the balance between preservation and use can tilt somewhat more towards user group interests.

The first and obvious answer to this question is to preserve and expand the existing greenways network. The greenways and paths have the advantage of fully separating cyclists and pedestrians from motor vehicles, ensuring a high degree of safety for all modes, and enabling more rapid transit by cyclists and peds due to the underpasses that accompany the greenway system. It almost goes without saying that the current sidewalk system needs to be maintained, and expanded to areas that desire it, mostly for the benefit of peds, but in certain areas for bikes as well. Maintaining road-level multi-use paths is the next-best set of solutions for bikes and peds, as some degree of physical separation exists between modes, though curb-cuts and turning autos still present some level of auto interaction with bikes/peds. The next-best set of solutions is street-level bike lanes which have some form of physical separation, as in the existing pilot along Folsom between Valmont and Spruce. Finally, stripe-separated bike lanes along most city streets allows bikes between sidewalks and vehicle lanes, and while this is the least safe of the network solutions, it provides access to all areas of the City. The Safe Streets Boulder program is an example of Boulder’s efforts towards better safety for all modes.`

From the RethinkTransportation Report:

“We are on the cusp of one of the fastest, deepest, most consequential disruptions of transportation in history. By 2030, within 10 years of regulatory approval of autonomous vehicles (AVs), 95% of U.S. Passenger miles traveled will be served by on-demand autonomous electric vehicles owned by fleets, not individuals, in a new business model we call “transportas-a-service” (TaaS). The TaaS disruption will have enormous implications across the transportation and oil industries, decimating entire portions of their value chains, causing oil demand and prices to plummet, and destroying trillions of dollars in investor value — but also creating trillions of dollars in new business opportunities, consumer surplus and GDP growth.”

To leverage this impending disruption, Boulder, in collaboration with as many municipalities in the metro area as possible, need to begin exploring policy options that will make the most sense for our area and our transportation infrastructure. This change could potentially have a dramatic effect on GHG reduction(go from a nation of 247 million cars to 44 million) and so we should pursue policies that ensure the best effect possible.`

For the last year, I have been increasingly commuting by electric bike, putting over 1000 miles on the bike during the first year of ownership. The current County programs for electric vehicle sales (including both autos and bikes) are a good start in incentivizing this transition. City codes have been adopted for new construction to require some charging facilities in new buildings, and the City provides 44 charging stations (and counting) across its parking system. Working with RTD to provide the best possible options to encourage high use of transit remains an important strategy, including subsidizing more bus frequency on heavily-used routes, and continuing to work towards a community-wide EcoPass.
