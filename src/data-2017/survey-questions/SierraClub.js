goals of clean energy and energy efficiency. I have championed smaller dwellings, in-fill, and creative ideas to to
address climate change through the building envelope, energy efficiency, and transportation.

My biggest environmental achievement is co-founding a company that makes tiny homes and structures from upcycled
shipping containers. Investing my own money and time, I have demonstrated my commitment to the
environment by a) recycling shipping containers that otherwise would become nature’s waste or melted down b)
building small c) building energy efficient structures. We have designed and received approval from the U.S. Forest
Service for a bike hut to be used in on a bike trail in Utah.

On a smaller scale, I have a very small, but important role as a volunteer OSMP Raptor Monitor. I help to monitor
peregrine falcons on a closure area south of Boulder. It’s the most rewarding thing I do.`

We organized and worked on many trail projects in the city, the county and on national forest and BLA land. I trained as a trail crew leader and led many of the aforementioned trail projects. In doing so, I learned much about how trails and trail design interplays with impacts of erosion from rain, snow and user behavior.

In the mid-2000's, I became involved in the carsharing movement. I was appointed to the board of eGo CarShare which I served on for 3 years. During that time, I worked with the organization's executive director to apply for its first Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality grant. eGo was awarded $190,000 which set the stage for the organization's growth from purely a small used car operation to one that now competes in the metro area with the big national for profit companies that have entered the arena.

In 2009, I joined the staff of Growing Gardens working on design and build of community gardens. After my employment I briefly served on the board. Through this experience I honed my personal gardening skills which have given me an appreciation for how soil and weather affects, on a micro basis, my ability to grow healthy edible plants. On a macro level, it has enabled me to notice, year to year, the variation in weather (and by extension, climate) and how it is affecting our ability as human beings to coax life sustaining food out of the earth.

I left the engineering profession about a decade ago because I became increasingly concerned about my participation in perpetuating the consumerist society that fuels our economy. Much of what we do as humans is simply not sustainable.

I believe that we need to change the language around climate change from “saving the planet” to “saving ourselves.” This anthropocene era that we are in follows 5 other extinctions of life on this planet. Yet, the planet has survived, will we?`

A strong educational social media campaign could do more to help reach our goals at no additional environmental cost.

Second, I think it’s important to partner with CU more effectively to reduce waste. Students represent 30,000 residents of our community who are trying to get an education, and while surveying indicates we have a very environmentally considerate student body, the reality of each spring cleanout shows that there is room to improve. Establishing drop off sites throughout the city for hard to recycle items two times a year is a great way for both students and the whole community to get rid of items in an environmentally conscious way.

September to see how difficult and time-consuming the effort will continue to be.

We’ve spent 7+ years and close to $20M, and we’re asking the voters for another $16.5M to get to a “go/no-go”

If we cannot municipalize, not only does the effort move to change things at the state level, but gains momentum through support of all the other municipalities within the state that have been carefully watching the outcome of Boulder's effort. I would support municipalizing if the PUC rules in our favor. If not, I would support a strong effort at the state level.`

Boulder is committed to a carbon-emissions-free electricity system by 2030.

gas generation, that would be a huge win. Over time, we can then replace the remaining gas generation with clean
energy. Natural gas generation releases half the CO2 of coal generation. 50% natural gas generation and 50%

Section 176 of the charter enumerates the purposes of Open Space. The third purpose is: “(c) Preservation of land for passive recreational use, such as hiking, photography or nature studies, and, if specifically designated, bicycling, horseback riding, or fishing;” I predict that this purpose will be the one that gathers most of the public and master planning process attention.

The questions this section raises for me are “How much recreational use?” “At what costs?” “Who pays?” Good stewardship will look to answer these questions. Costs should not be assessed only monetarily but also in terms of eco-systems services and impacts to flora and fauna.

We have created an asset in our city that both nurtures us and plagues us. Chautauqua currently receives more visitors than Rocky Mountain National Park, with the number of visitors at Mt. Sanitas close behind. This is good for our economy, but bad for the land and the flora and fauna which it nurtures. Add to the questions above the the following factors: climate change and fire risk, rise in homeless transients choosing to camp there, diminishing funding for Open Space and you have a wicked problem in formulating a broadly acceptable stewardship plan.

The different ecological types of land managed by OSMP are already well-categorized in other documents, and guidelines and criteria for uses in each type should be set forth, without making specific determinations of use within sites. Theories of management for the different area types should be laid out clearly. Management of uses should be spelled out explicitly, and every effort should be made to allow as many uses on trails as possible without causing appreciable degradation of the local ecological and habitat value of the land. Where user conflicts are noted, the plan should be creative in proposing strategies for managing uses, considering approaches such as alternating uses by schedule (temporal separation) and using use restrictions only when levels of use conflict are unacceptable, or when given uses are causing degradation of the habitat values.`

This very general question is difficult to answer in a general way except to describe principles to apply in case-by-case determinations.

The tensions inherent to the discussion of how much use, when and where are inherent in the purposes listed, which include passive recreation as well as preservation. A guiding principle for me is that OSMP habitat which shelters threatened or endangered species (both vegetation and wildlife) should be treated with the utmost care, and that in those areas, preservation values must be addressed first. In areas in which primarily more common species are found, the balance between preservation and use can tilt somewhat more towards user group interests. Regardless of the regulations developed, enforcement should be strong in order to preserve natural values and minimize user conflict.`

The City has built an extensive network of east-west bike paths, based on our creeks and flood control areas. While
using these paths sometimes take a commuter a little longer than a road would, I support their use for recreation
and commuting. However, we need to create more north/south bicycle routes to connect to make commuting by
bike a more viable option. Bike lanes on busy roads like Folsom are not an option for families with kids.

We need to make sure drivers obey speed limits and crosswalk crossings, and we should evaluate intersections for
safety in left hand turn lanes (delayed lights). We need to make sure our streets are free of potholes and
obstructions that cause bike injuries. I also think we should consider a small bicycle license fee and some
educational PR to educate about bike laws, pedestrian laws, and evangelize safe driving, riding, and walking.`

The first and obvious answer to this question is to preserve and expand the existing greenways network. The greenways and paths have the advantage of fully separating cyclists and pedestrians from motor vehicles, ensuring a high degree of safety for all modes, and enabling more rapid transit by cyclists and peds due to the underpasses that accompany the greenway system. It almost goes without saying that the current sidewalk system needs to be maintained, and expanded to areas that desire it, mostly for the benefit of peds, but in certain areas for bikes as well. Maintaining road-level multi-use paths is the next-best set of solutions for bikes and peds, as some degree of physical separation exists between modes, though curb-cuts and turning autos still present some level of auto interaction with bikes/peds. The next-best set of solutions is street-level bike lanes which have some form of physical separation, as in the existing pilot along Folsom between Valmont and Spruce. Finally, stripe-separated bike lanes along most city streets allows bikes between sidewalks and vehicle lanes, and while this is the least safe of the network solutions, it provides access to all areas of the City. The Safe Streets Boulder program is an example of Boulder’s efforts towards better safety for all modes.`

From the RethinkTransportation Report:

“We are on the cusp of one of the fastest, deepest, most consequential disruptions of transportation in history. By 2030, within 10 years of regulatory approval of autonomous vehicles (AVs), 95% of U.S. Passenger miles traveled will be served by on-demand autonomous electric vehicles owned by fleets, not individuals, in a new business model we call “transportas-a-service” (TaaS). The TaaS disruption will have enormous implications across the transportation and oil industries, decimating entire portions of their value chains, causing oil demand and prices to plummet, and destroying trillions of dollars in investor value — but also creating trillions of dollars in new business opportunities, consumer surplus and GDP growth.”

To leverage this impending disruption, Boulder, in collaboration with as many municipalities in the metro area as possible, need to begin exploring policy options that will make the most sense for our area and our transportation infrastructure.

· Maximizing the open space for future residents of CU South and current residents of nearby neighborhoods. Ensuring neighborhood trail connections and trail connections to other southern OSMP properties.
· Using the open space as the primary flood mitigation area.
· Working with CU to slow or eliminate the growth in enrollment unless it is tied to
additional housing options for students.
· Maximizing commuting options to campus and the rest of Boulder that do not involve
cars. This could be the best example of what an almost car-less village could look like.`

These are both issues that require expert analysis which is currently underway. I will be looking to these experts to carefully weigh how we can make sure that flood mitigation is done properly and sensitively and that wildlife is protected.`

          "answer": `For the annexation agreement to move forward, the city must use the option that will (per city staff) “minimize impacts to sensitive species from nearby OSMP properties and minimize impacts to sensitive environmental resources.” The option that fits the criteria is Alternative D for berm construction. Additionally, the proposed zoning boundaries must protect the native riparian and herbaceous wetlands located at the southern and south-eastern portions of the property. CU wants a minimally-binding agreement for long-term flexibility in development that is 10-20 years into the future, but needs to align with housing, transportation plan, and environmental goals of the city.`

          "answer": `Flood mitigation is first and foremost in this negotiation. We have to take all steps possible to prevent catastrophic flooding from occurring in our community. Building on a floodplain requires an extreme dedication to studying and planning before anything is built. As a member of the community who lives in a garden level condo that flooded in 2013 I’m aware of the toll such events take on our community. Aside from proper flood planning we need to take proper steps to keep as much of the natural environment in this unique part of our city untouched. Maximizing porous surfaces and keeping as much of the natural vegetation as possible will both reduce flood potential and the impact on nature.`

          "answer": `CU has every right to develop this land, so our top priority should be to minimize the impacts on the environment and surrounding community. I suggest a bold idea that would be a land swap agreement between CU and Flatirons Golf Course. CU would build on Arapahoe where there are already services to support that development. Flatirons Golf Course would move to the CU South property and would be designed as an environmentally friendly and flood-mitigated golf course that thus limits the impacts on the surrounding community. A great example of this is Fox Hollow Golf Course in Jefferson County.`

          "answer": `•	A much more complete survey of onsite endangered /threatened species should be done, similar to what the Fish and Wildlife Department would do.  Why – because nothing of that magnitude has been done.  Without it, it’s impossible to know what will be lost or endangered by development.  The area is part of Colorado’s single largest stand of mesic tall grass prairie, and is home to many endangered/threatened species that Biohabitat’s quick survey did not assess.
•	Any annexation should recognize that this portion of the South Boulder Creek ecosystem is extremely important for habitat, flood plain preservation and flood control. Why – the Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan contains guiding principles that address areas of preservation and restoration of flood plains, including the 500-year flood plain. Removal of the existing levy is key to restoration of the area, as the plan outlines.
•	Complete assessment of surface- and groundwater, and aquifer must be done, because it hasn’t been done. Why – because without it, construction impacts are unknown.  100,000 feet3 of concrete foundations displace 100,000 feet3 of water, which must go somewhere. Tantra Park, Fraser Meadows and Hogan Pancost share this same very high aquifer and may be impacted.

And, we need to make sure that there is appropriate consideration of any development on that property for groundwater and other unique environmental features. Finally, as CU considers its developments, Council should pay close attention to the impacts on nearby neighborhood, including preservation of appropriate Open Space and recreational corridors.

          "answer": `addressed either before, or as a condition of annexation.  These include road and traffic connections, the flood control and management considerations both for the CU South property and the downstream areas which could be affected, the manner in which undeveloped CU South areas will be managed, conditions of public access to the area, the types of development (e.g. residential, office, teaching facilities, laboratory, sports, support facilities, etc.) and the size/design characteristics.

          I understand the City will be carrying out a review by consultants of its decision to move ahead with the “Option D” proposal for flood mitigation and protection.  I believe that a competent, comprehensive and objective review will recommend major changes to the “Option D” proposal, and that it would therefore be premature to enter into any annexation-related negotiations until completion of that review.

          I would seek to ensure that, as has already been identified by the Planning Board and the City Council, that building be kept out of the 500-year flood plain, that residential development be focused on affordable housing, that public access to the area and its public open space surroundings be guaranteed, that as much area as possible remain naturally vegetated and undeveloped. `

          "answer": `First of all, the city must be a tough negotiator at the table when drafting the annexation agreement. All of our leverage rests prior to annexation. Now that the Comp Plan has passed, the CU South Guiding Principles will serve as the primary document to steer that agreement. It is a strong document that addresses the concerns of all stakeholders. We should not annex without heeding to those guiding principles.

Much of the 300+ acres of the CU South property lie on the 100 and 500 year flood plains. This should be respected for environmental and flood mitigation reasons. We must protect the wetlands and endangered species. When you look at an aerial view (see below, one is water depth the other water velocity) of the area, it is abundantly clear this is South Boulder Creek's alluvial fan. To the extent we can respect this natural function as outlined in the BVCP, everyone will benefit.`

          "answer": `I am proud of the progress we have made to date at protecting habitat on the CU South property. I spent a great deal of time and effort negotiating to increase the amount of OS-O designation as part of the Comprehensive Plan update to a higher area than staff suggested. While CU owns the land, there is potentially greater habitat value on the land than the 80 acres that staff suggested for OS-O designation, and I worked with Tracy Winfree and others to learn that much of the area within the CU levee could potentially be restored to a good wetland habitat ecology, if the levee were breached. Armed with this knowledge, I was able to work with CU representatives and fellow Council members to take the Open Space designation from a staff-recommended 80 acres to an area closer to 160 acres. Further, we designated the flood detention area that may be built as part of the high-hazard dam project on South Boulder Creek as a Parks-style land use on which no buildings can be constructed. With all of this in place as well as the adopted guiding principles, I will work to make sure that any Annexation agreement will have a high degree of focus on habitat preservation and restoration, and the potential building area on this property will now be focused on the western portion. I will work for dedication of permanent open space on the 160 acres designated as OS-O, and for permanent access to the portions of the property that will be used for flood control.`
