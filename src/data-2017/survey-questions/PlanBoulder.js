Boulder’s great, but we must continue to evolve – we’re not done yet! We need to crowd source our wisdom, which will require new outreach methods – insisting upon attendance at public hearings will not suffice.
Council members should be approachable and they should have well-established relationships with a diverse mix of community members, through the sort of extensive and varied types of community service I have volunteered to perform

We should be optimistic about where we’re headed, because of what we have already done.

It’s is our generation’s time to lead the change we envision for this world. The polarization we see at the national and state level is not motivating our generation to be a part of the process of government. I intend to change that by being a moderating and stabilizing force in our local government to keep the pendulum from swinging too far in any one direction. I will consistently review issues with a data driven, evidence-based approach. My top three priorities are Effective Governance, Affordable Housing and Renewable Energy. I view Effective Governance as the foundation from which we measure our success or failure in reaching the goals we set for the array of issues we face in our community. I will bring a “quality over quantity” approach to Council and use evidence-based decision making to truly deliver on our goals. My career in the science and education community has given me the experience to learn that often time less is more and when trying to do too many things at once the overall quality will suffer.

          Affordable housing is my second priority. We are currently witnessing the decline of the young working family in Boulder. Boulder has done well in building truly affordable housing but has done little to provide middle-income housing. We need a diversity of housing to offer an economic ladder for these young working families to thrive. My third priority is renewable energy. Here too, effective governance has made it harder for Boulder to reach its climate goals. Boulder has become distracted by our municipal utility efforts and we continue to not pursue a variety of solutions that get us to our goals. Boulder is famous for world leading climate research, let’s match that by leading in climate action.`

I represent a fresh perspective – as a younger candidate, a businesswoman, a Boulder native, and a volunteer firefighter who understands the plight of our emergency responder and service community.  I’m also a former resident of affordable housing who went on to buy a house in the city portion of Boulder’s Gunbarrel with my husband.

I have really been hearing people’s concerns about the type of growth we’re seeing in Boulder, and the ever-increasing traffic. I have also heard people’s struggles to afford to live in Boulder. I understand those challenges, having lived in affordable housing myself.  Yet I believe we can create affordability, without universal high density and runaway growth.

I straddle many worlds that don’t often intersect in Boulder. This puts me in an excellent position to facilitate the elusive solutions our community really needs now. I know that with the talents, skills, and education of the people of Boulder, we can create more win-win solutions that work for everyone. `

I believe that Boulder has become a center of real estate investment and speculation activity that the City is allowing without requiring mitigation or compensation for the associated adverse impacts on Boulder’s infrastructure, private and public housing resources, open space and aesthetic resources.  My contribution to the City Council will, among other things, be to focus on the issues described above, and to focus on improving the process for public input and decision making so that decisions will be more transparent - and better.  In general, I believe that the City has been too reactive, rather than proactive, with respect to the manner in which development is taking place, and that Boulder’s past willingness to “pay it forward” to future generations with clear concerns for public benefits should continue to be our guide.`

community passes the Utility Occupation Tax, we will spend another $16.5 M just to get us to a
“go or no-go” decision, likely in 2020. This will put our financial reserves at risk, due to spending
the money before the Utility Occupation Tax revenue comes in. If we win our legal and
regulatory battle, we will then need to invest +$250M to separate, condemn Xcel assets, and
pay for stranded costs. It costs too much, with too much risk, and it doesn’t guarantee we’ll get
any further than Xcel will in the same timeframe. In fact, we may reach our goals later than
they will.

Last week, Xcel made their own announcement about reaching 55% renewables by 2026 by
retiring two coal plants and reducing carbon emissions by 60 percent from 2005 levels, all while
lowering costs to customers. This announcement proves that market forces as well as our
pressure and pressure from other cities is impacting Xcel’s strategy. That, with the verbal
reading we got from the PUC is the final indicator to me that we should go in a different
direction.

What would I do?

1) Partner with Denver, the State, and Xcel to work together to attain our
targets, which will do more to further climate goals at the state level. We should involve Rocky
Mountain Institute, Conservation Colorado, Western Resource, and Sierra Club as well.

2) Work
on our transportation sector, especially with Electric Vehicles 3) Use some of the money we
save from not continuing down the muni path to create a solar farm 4) Look at land use and

for sale, are increasing. A lot.

In addition, we have created such an arduous and expensive process for getting approvals for
housing, it adds significantly to the cost. This includes heavy fees in building affordable housing,
even for our own Housing Authority and other non-profit and for-profit affordable housing
builders.

I support using public funds to buy buildings and land, zoning for more effective land use
(perhaps more mixed-use), more dense in-fill, especially in transit corridors, and light in-fill with
creative solutions in neighborhoods (ADU’s, allowance for split lots, duplexes on corners, etc.)
In addition, I support waiving some fees for our affordable housing developers and fast-tracking
of the approval process for affordable housing. I highly encourage us to work with Boulder
County and the consortium of BOCO cities to address this as a regional problem. We should tie
transportation in with our land use planning. I applaud many of the ideas from the Back Porch
group and PLAN-Boulder County, and I’d love to see a neighborhood trial where we encourage
creativity in solving problems at the neighborhood level. I support the most recent Inclusionary
housing policy approved by Council. Net/net, we all need to work together to solve a basic need
of humanity: housing. If we will work together, rather than choose sides, we can accomplish
much for Boulder families.`

We can drag them kicking and screaming towards meeting our goals, but if they aren't still with us when we're done, our already too expensive housing will become even more so.

Every new dwelling unit we build in Boulder should appeal to one of our in-commuters. They're already here. We must keep trying to build them homes. To do nothing leaves us where we are today, with personal wealth as Boulder's "sorting hat."

o	I’d support re-zoning some commercial- and industrial-zoned lands, into residential.
o	Yet, since each job represents 2.4 people on average(counting spouses and children), it’s unrealistic to house an additional 144,000 in Boulder.
o	And, many in-commuters may not want to live in Boulder.  Many probably enjoy lower housing costs, and get more for their money, where they currently live.
o	So I’d take a regional approach, and encourage locating more jobs in our surrounding communities, so their residents can work closer to home.  This would help the environment, congestion, and global warming.
•	CU’s ever-increasing enrollment.  Students compete in, and add pressure to, Boulder’s ultra-expensive housing market.  Easing  this demand will help. CU should supply more reasonably-priced housing for students on its current properties.

Boulder can more successfully create mixed-use neighborhoods that offer convenient and affordable access to restaurants and bars, transportation, shopping, and other amenities. As a resident in the Uptown Broadway neighborhood, I believe these 15-minute-type neighborhoods offer viable solutions to Boulder’s needs around housing, reducing traffic congestion, and building community.

As Boulder’s economy continues to grow and attract more businesses and better paying jobs, it will become increasingly important to offset rising home prices with a diversity of housing options that ensure that residents are not squeezed or pushed outside of Boulder for housing needs, which will only compound our traffic headaches.

* Tuesday night, the Council started the process of ratcheting up the Affordable Housing
requirement from 20 to 25%. I support that move and also the changes that provide
developers with incentives to build affordable housing on-site and to include housing for
middle-income residents.

* New commercial/industrial developments should be responsible for providing funds to
house their employees who are paid salaries at and below AMI. Keyser Marston’s
linkage fee recommendation was set at a level that would require linkage fees to
accomplish that. Because I believe that people need to be held responsible for costs
they impose on our community, I support a fee higher than the one Council passed in
the last year.

* The City needs to come up with a plan to maintain current housing that’s affordable to
low and middle-income residents. This will not be easy, but if the solution agreed to by
Council requires new revenues, we should look for innovative ways to fund it or if

increased the fees from $9.53 to $12, and the fees have only been in place for a couple years,
so we don’t know the impact of the fees. Developers (or landlords) will increase the rents (or
purchase price of the property) to accommodate the linkage fees.(Despite what some people
think, developers will NOT take it in the shorts….they will just build this into the proforma). The
businesses who lease the property will need to increase their prices to accommodate the rent,
so they won’t have the money to pay their employees more (which is what we really need).
Rents all over the rest of the city will also increase accordingly (market prices will be set by the
new building). All other businesses will have to increase their prices to cover their rents, and if
they can’t, they will have to move out of the city or go out of business. It’s likely higher costs
can be absorbed by large companies and chain retailers who can average costs across the
country, but it will be less easily absorbed by local small businesses. We are already hearing
about small businesses in Boulder who are suffering due to the cost of rent. Net/net, the cost of
$12 will already drive up the costs for small business and non-profits. It will drive up cost of
living, which our lower and middle income residents do not need. I do not support raising the

Retail sales generated from commercial development, and the multiplier effect, make up the difference, which explains why western civilization has not gone bankrupt.

The $12 fee was chosen responsibly and will prime a pump that combines cash-in-lieu fees with non-profit, state and federal funding to build more affordable low- and middle-income housing than the private sector can build without such subsidies. If the $12 fee proves insufficient, I would be willing to revisit the calculation in the future. Development excise fees must be roughly proportional to demonstrable impacts, and must be earmarked, spent and accounted for to meet statutory and constitutional requirements.

a)	Recognize that CU, also, needs to be mindful of the carrying capacity of the Boulder Valley.
b)	CU definitely should be responsible for housing its additional students and they should be housed on CU’s currently developed lands.  CU has a great deal of land at its East Campus.  Rather than just developing East Campus as academic and research buildings and conference rooms, CU should be building more student housing there.
c)	Many public universities in the U.S. require students to live on campus for their first two years (freshman and sophomore).  CU Boulder requires only freshmen to live on campus.  If ever a university should require freshmen and sophomores to live on campus, it’d be CU Boulder, given the exceedingly difficult local housing market that sophomores face.

we allow outdoor expedition companies to take groups. Perhaps we should encourage them to

We should consider charging outside-of-city cars to park and encourage people to take buses to
the properties. I’d love to see connectors with all our properties and those of the County to
encourage more bikers to ride between properties.

Caps should be a last resort, done once we’ve tried everything else, and I would support caps

There is reason to question whether certain trails and popular areas are being over-utilized, but before restricting what will obviously be a popular option, I would want to explore how to better protect trail segments and open space areas for the many users who use them on high volume days, while preserving access at other times. Parking access tends to be self-limiting, but those who visit an area by other means should be allowed to continue to do so. Numeric caps are problematic because they fail to distinguish among various users, some of whom tread very lightly on such lands.

As I have learned through my own experiences with Open Space, I believe that facilitating responsible usage encourages greater preservation, and that we have an obligation as a community to discuss usage levels and appropriate levels of maintenance.

•	Modern construction of residential or commercial buildings involves subterranean concrete foundations and footers.  It’s simple displacement: 100,000 ft. 3 of subterranean concrete = 100,000 ft. 3 of subterranean groundwater that must go somewhere.
•	We know where it will go.  After the East Boulder Rec Center construction, residents in the adjacent, established neighborhood began having to run sump pumps in their basements.  This will worsen, if HP is annexed and developed.
•	The property serves a vital function as a wetland, and natural retention ground in the event of heavy rain and flood events.  Such areas should be preserved for these reasons – for safety.
•	Hurricane Harvey‘s impact was made much worse, because of the City of Houston allowing development throughout their bayou and wetland areas.  Development-friendly policies whittled away at zoning restrictions that previously didn’t allow development.  We saw the results.

use it. While I understand that the SKIP occasionally is full, it is often empty. Our in-city bus
service is just not adequate to get people where they need to go in a reasonable timeframe. I
ride the bus a lot, and it takes 45 minutes on the bus (with walk time) vs. 10 minutes in the car
and 15 minutes on a bike. Electric bikes, Uber, and other transportation options should be
considered as well as an Eco Pass. We should look at the travel times, pros and cons, and cost
of each methodology.

For years, the City’s plan to reduce GHG emissions from transportation has depended on efforts
to move people out of single-occupancy vehicles into shared vehicles and buses, bicycles, and
foot travel. It is increasingly being predicted that surface transportation will soon be dominated
by self-driving, electric-powered vehicles owned by large organizations and rented to users on a
ride-by-ride basis. Do you think this prediction will be fulfilled in the next 20 years? If yes, how
should the City prepare for, and respond to this new transportation reality?

I don’t know what will happen, but it will be dramatically different in 10 years much less 20. The
“sharing” economy is growing dramatically. I just sold my car and would prefer not buying
another one if I can get by without it. Many people already use Uber and Lyft, and I see a
movement of older women getting on electric bikes (myself included). What should we do?
First, get behind electric vehicles and bikes in a big way: hiring a dedicated person, converting
the city fleet, evangelize the companies to put in charging stations, convert our buses to EV’s,
etc. In addition, we should work with Rocky Mountain Institute, Google, and other creative local
companies to work on innovative trials to test some of the cool ideas coming forward. `

•	New auto parking structures built today, should be designed as “flexible purpose” buildings (i.e. with level floors, so they could be converted to residential structures in 20 years, if this prediction comes true).
•	We should explore how to recycle all the materials and embodied energy in current automobiles, when they become obsolete.
•	For years, BMW Germany has built 100% recyclable cars.  They’ve done that because the German government requires manufacturing companies to be responsible for the products they make, cradle to grave.  Perhaps Boulder could begin to encourage this, if we’ll soon have that many obsolete vehicles.

From the RethinkTransportation Report:

“We are on the cusp of one of the fastest, deepest, most consequential disruptions of transportation in history. By 2030, within 10 years of regulatory approval of autonomous vehicles (AVs), 95% of U.S. Passenger miles traveled will be served by on-demand autonomous electric vehicles owned by fleets, not individuals, in a new business model we call “transportas-a-service” (TaaS). The TaaS disruption will have enormous implications across the transportation and oil industries, decimating entire portions of their value chains, causing oil demand and prices to plummet, and destroying trillions of dollars in investor value — but also creating trillions of dollars in new business opportunities, consumer surplus and GDP growth.”

To leverage this impending disruption, Boulder, in collaboration with as many municipalities in the metro area as possible, need to begin exploring policy options that will make the most sense for our area and our transportation infrastructure. This change could potentially have a dramatic effect on GHG reductions (go from a nation of 247 million cars to 44 million) and so we should pursue policies that ensure the best effect possible.`
