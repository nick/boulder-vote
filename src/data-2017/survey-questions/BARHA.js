        answer: `I’m running for Council because I have had two years on the Council to learn, and I now have a better view of what needs to be done to improve governance of the City and accountability to our citizens. I hope to win a 4-year seat so I can make a difference in the Council and in the City. I will bring a practical, common-sense approach to solving the problems of this community. In addition, my entrepreneurial background gives me that kind of mindset to opportunities within the city, whether it be housing, environment, transportation, or the arts. Plus, I’ll be the budget watchdog.`

        answer: `I’ve lived in Boulder for 36 years, raising a family, working, playing, and volunteering with friends and colleagues throughout Boulder County. I want to ensure that your voices and concerns are heard and understood by City Council. There are 9 seats on City Council and 5 of them are in play. I believe my problem-solving approach, knowledge of Boulder’s recent history (36 years), work experience, volunteer service, legal training and understanding of planning principles will add value to Council’s deliberations.`

        answer: `<p>While I can’t say that I was born in Boulder, I can say that Boulder is my home. I arrived in 1977 for the rock climbing, cycling, food, and culture. I stayed and went to CU and graduated with a BFA. I worked at the Spoke (bike shop), Novan Energy (solar energy), and various other Boulder companies.</p>
<p>For the last 30 years I have been an owner and partner at Marketing Technologies, a technical sales company selling US made custom metal and plastic parts from US manufacturers to US equipment manufacturers. This has given me an understanding of how companies, both large and small, work, survive, grow, thrive and sometimes fail.</p>
<p>I met Jill, my wife of 34 years and partner in life here. We feel fortunate to have raised our two kids, Molly and Reed, here in this community that we love so much. Our family has settled and grown in Boulder, including our children and their spouses, our two grandchildren, elderly parents, and siblings, four generations in total</p>
<p>I actively examine all aspects of my life and my impact on the planet. While not always successful, I am committed to my personal goals for the environment, my community and the greater world.</p>
<p>I know Boulder:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the preschools to the senior centers.</li>
<li>By having lived in rental apartments on the Hill and in Goss Grove to single family homes in Central and North Boulder.</li>
<li>Because my work experience spans roughneck in the oil field to solar sales, retail to manufacturing and ultimately building a local business with a 30 year history in Boulder.</li>
<li>From volunteering in schools, to serving on boards and commissions, to getting dirty building trails, to being a lifetime blood donor to driving for Meals on Wheels.</li>

        answer: `<p>I am running for City Council because engaging with my community and finding solutions to challenges that face us all is my passion. Now - more than ever - Boulder needs passionate, experienced, diverse leaders to help lead the way on housing, our energy future, transportation, open space, social justice issues, and business support.</p>
<p>I am the mother of two young boys, Ryder and Treker, both of whom help inform my vision for the future of our community. I moved to Boulder 11 years ago after completing my degree in Political Science at The College of William & Mary. I quickly fell in love with Boulder’s natural beauty, creative spirit and commitment to the environment. My first year here I taught civics at The Watershed School where I engaged with my students in community issues and volunteered with Meals on Wheels. Later, I joined the Board of New Era Colorado where I served for five years. Through New Era I helped launch a campaign to reduce disposable bags. That campaign resulted in our bag fee ordinance, which has prevented thousands of bags from entering our landfill.</p>
<p>I am currently the Vice Chair of the City of Boulder Board of Zoning Adjustments and serve on the board of Thistle Communities, a nonprofit dedicated to bringing more affordable housing to Boulder. For the last few years I have worked as an advocate for our mobile home communities, helping save dozens of families from eviction, and ultimately working with state legislators to help pass a bill to save mobile homes from tax lien investors.</p>
<p>I participated in the Chamber of Commerce leadership program, have served on multiple housing working groups, and have been named one of the top ”40 under Forty young professionals who are shaping the future of the Boulder Valley” by BizWest.</p>`

        answer: `<p>I’m Eric Budd and I’m running for Boulder City Council because I believe we need bold, progressive leadership to fight climate change, to honestly face our critical housing and transportation demands, and to become a more welcoming community with broader participation in local decisions.</p>
<p>Climate change is the top issue of our planet and we’re not going to see action from the federal level. we need to continue to take strong action to achieve 100% renewable energy, reduce our emissions from our transportation as well as commercial and residential development.</p>
<p>Housing is a critical issue for my generation — we need to do more to make sure that young people, families, and the middle class can afford to live and stay in Boulder. On city council, I’ll push forward on housing policy that keeps Boulder accessible, gives transportation options to all people, and protects the quality of life that Boulder residents love.</p>
<p>I believe local government is a place where everyone has a say. we need to make it easier for more people to have an impact on decisions that affect them, particularly those who are underrepresented in our city government and public processes, including people who rent, people who are younger, and people of color.</p>
<p>Over the last seven years I have become more and more involved in our community:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve worked as a project and product manager for technology companies in the Boulder area</li>
<li>I worked on a connected toy startup helped kids learn engineering</li>
<li>analyzed B-cycle bike sharing system usage to understand how a system of bikes help people get around the city</li>
<li>delivered an Ignite Boulder talk on creative housing options in the city</li>
<li>completed the 2015 Ironman Boulder</li>
<li>served on committees for Community Cycles and Better Boulder, worked with the Boulder Community Housing Association</li>
<li>President of Newland Court Condo Association to successfully lead homeowners through a difficult restoration</li>
<li>I currently chair the City of Boulder Landmarks Board.</li>

        answer: ` I’ve been a member of the Boulder community for the last 11 years.  I came to boulder for college at the University of Colorado and graduated in 2010 with a BS in Business with emphasis in Marketing.  I’ve spent eight years in the rowing community, four during college and four more the as the Head Men’s Coach of the University of Colorado Rowing Team.  After graduating I’ve had to maintain two jobs at all times to keep up with the rising rents in Boulder. I’m running for City Council to help represent the younger and working class members of our community who don’t have enough representation right now.  My goal is to reduce the growing inequality in our community so more people can live where they work and help stem the tide of our commuter culture.`

        answer: `I have lived in Boulder for 16 years and currently live in South Boulder with my wife, Jessica, and son, Mason. After graduating from CU in 2005 with a degree in Astronomy and Astrophysics, I spent the next 11 years working for CU as an Astronomer and the Education Programs Manager for Fiske Planetarium. While at Fiske, I collaborated on several NASA research grants and educational programs with our local federal labs and aerospace companies. I am currently Board President of the Growe Foundation, which initiates and supports school garden programs through curriculum lesson plans for 19 elementary schools in the Boulder Valley School District. I am also working with the Idaho Conservation League on its efforts to create the nation’s first Dark Sky Reserve in central Idaho. I am running for Boulder City Council because as a young father and husband I realize it’s crucial to put our Future First. It’s is our generation’s time to lead the change we envision for this world. The polarization we see at the national and state level is not motivating our generation to be a part of the process of government. I intend to change that by being a moderating and stabilizing force in our local government to keep the pendulum from swinging too far in any one direction. I will consistently review issues with a data driven, evidence-based approach. Boulder seems to be at a crossroads that sounds eerily similar to that of the National one, do we want to be an inclusive community that creates opportunities for current and future generations, or do we want to close the gates behind us and limit who gets to have opportunity for success?`

        answer: `<p>I’m running for Council because I care deeply about Boulder – the place where I was born and raised. I’m running because I believe better solutions need to be crafted, that can bring the community together rather than pushing it apart.</p>
<p>I represent a fresh perspective – as a younger candidate, a businesswoman, a Boulder native, a Gunbarrel (City of Boulder portion) resident, and a volunteer firefighter who deeply understands our emergency professionals who daily put their lives on the line for us. I’m also an affordable housing alumnus, who saved enough to eventually buy a home.</p>
<p>I straddle many worlds that don’t often intersect. This puts me in an excellent position to facilitate the elusive solutions Boulder really needs now. Rather than settling for winners and losers, our city can do better by working together. If elected, I’ll work tirelessly to create win-wins.</p>`

        answer: `<p>I am running for the Boulder City Council because I love our town! I love Boulder for all of its outdoor and cultural assets, for its interesting and accomplished residents, and for all of its unique quirks. I also know that Boulder is facing a variety of challenges that we need to address to make it an even better and more welcoming community. We need to make our streets and civic spaces safer, we need innovative transportation solutions to move people more efficiently from Point A to Point B, and we need to sustain the vitality of our economy while retaining our sense of community.</p>
<p>My key priorities as a City Council member reflect the above values. Specifically, I will bring a progressive voice to Council to make our neighborhood streets and civic spaces safer, to promote innovative transportation solutions with wider accessibility so we can reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions, and advance our economy through smart growth and middle-income housing strategies. As demonstrated through my professional career and volunteer public service roles, I have the experience, creativity and commitment to achieve these goals and the passion to make Boulder an even better place.</p>
<p>And finally, I rent my apartment in North Boulder, and if elected, I would be the only renter on Council. I believe it is critically important to ensure that the specific and unique needs of our renters, which accounts for more than 50% of Boulder, are fairly and appropriately represented on Council.</p>
<p>I have served as the chairman of the Transportation Advisory Board for the past two years, where I have worked alongside neighborhood associations, think tanks, and community groups to propel an agenda focused on safer streets for all users and reducing carbon emissions.</p>
<p>As a member of the Chamber’s Community Affairs Council, I serve alongside three dozen business and civic leaders across the entire spectrum to discuss and debate the most pressing public policy issues facing Boulder. I also serve on the Marijuana Advisory Panel and am a board member on the Boulder Ensemble Theater Company.</p>

        answer: `<p>I’m a long-term Boulder resident, CU grad, mother of two children   born and raised here, a twice elected official–Boulder City Council and University of Colorado Regent–and, with many, many others, have invested time, energy, and money into making Boulder the attractive and alluring community it is.  I’m running because I think Boulder stands at a crossroads with two clear choices: traditional progressive values and greater trust in government on one hand and an adherence to the principles of big money and dwindling trust in government on the other.</p>
<p>I think current government needs to listen better to the community — about issues from affordability to climate change to community participation in government. Boulder’s success in attracting business and the jobs/population imbalance have led to the city’s decline in retaining and welcoming diverse economic populations.  Boulder’s residents have clearly stated through various self-imposed taxes that they want strong action against climate change. Boulder’s Public Participation Working Group concluded that government needs to listen to its citizens and that necessitates a culture change in government practice. If elected, I’m committed to listening to our community on these and other compelling issues that–together–we may better manage our city.<p>`

        answer: `<p>I am the eldest of five first-generation children of Mexican immigrants, my first language was Spanish, and I grew up in the Mexican-American milieu of El Paso, Texas.</p>
<p>In 1978, while studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Texas at El Paso, IBM recruited me for a summer internship at IBM. After graduating, I received job offers ranging from designing calculators for Texas Instruments to a management program with General Electric. I chose Bell Laboratories in Denver and commuted there from Boulder. In 1982, after earning my Master’s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, I returned to Boulder and have lived here ever since.</p>
<p>I’m running because as a long-time resident of Boulder, I’ve seen first-hand the positive changes that make Boulder a great place to live, work, and visit. Many people in Boulder have done well for themselves — oftentimes a reflection of their ingenuity, courage, sacrifice, and hard work. On the other hand, I’ve also seen working individuals and families squeezed out of Boulder, unable to afford ever-increasing Boulder housing costs. Now more than ever, policies need to be crafted that put community first and people above profit. I’ve served on council for four years now and I feel like I’m just getting started.</p>`

        answer: `<p>My name is Sam Weaver, and I have lived in Boulder County for 28 years, and in the City of Boulder for 9 years.  Building on four years of hard work for our community and my experience in the business, civic, and environmental arenas, I’ll continue to lead on vital local issues of concern, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining a healthy business environment for the long term;</li>
<li>Achieving aggressive carbon emissions reductions; and</li>
<li>Supporting a sustainable community that actively cares for those in need.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m a founder of a Boulder–based clean energy technology company. As a job creator and innovator, I understand the world of Boulder’s start-up businesses. Our entrepreneurial culture is important to the community and should be nourished by the public sector. The largest of local businesses create economic stability and enable spin-offs and startups to innovate and grow. For ten years prior to starting my own business, I worked as a researcher at the University of Colorado. I understand first-hand the significant contributions that the University, Federal labs and the scientific community make to the local economy. As a Council member, I’ve bolstered and supported these important sectors.</p>
<p>I served on Boulder’s Planning Board in 2012, before being elected to Council in 2013. I deeply understand local land use issues and the how to effectively regulate growth and development in our community. With the support of fellow Council members and staff, I’ve helped implement some of the nation’s best commercial energy codes; rolled out commercial recycling and composting regulations; and supported adoption of some of the most energy-efficient new building codes in the country. In addition, the City organization has made great progress in reducing its own carbon emissions over the last four years while we’ve moved forward on exploring a local municipal electric utility.</p>
<p>I’ve consistently lobbied for increasing City support of our critical local nonprofits. How different our community would be without EFFA, Bridge House, VIA, Mental Health Partners, and many other community service organizations, including the City affordable housing and EXPAND programs. I support policies and organizations that achieve housing access and supply, while retaining a low-rise, compact city character.</p>
<p>Given the unfortunate state of the nation’s current leadership and political polarization, I believe local government should take even more progressive action. I am convinced that Boulder, of all places in the United States, has the ability to lead through environmentally sound initiatives, including a local clean electric utility, additional resilience programs such as community gathering places during crises, and a continuing focus on energy efficiency. At the same time, Boulder needs to lead the way in minimizing the impacts of natural gas, both in its extraction and in its use.</p>
<p>Since 2008, my wife Maggie and I have lived in the Whittier area.  In this eminently walkable neighborhood, there is diversity among residents and property types, a situation that is more and more challenging to preserve in the face of rapidly escalating home prices. Maintaining a range of housing options for Boulder residents is a priority for me, and I will fight for it if re-elected.</p>`

My experience there was great.  It was at a time in life where money was very tight for us, but we were young and loved our new life in Boulder.  My then husband and I slept on an air mattress, shared an old car, and worked hard.  I share this because while renters represent a wide range of incomes, many are in a similar place I was in 2003, without the comfort of equity in a home to fall back on in times of trouble.  Organizations like BARHA are important in representing and empowering rental property owners so that they can have a positive relationship with their tenants.`

I commented to my daughter that they were heavy-handed, and she quickly jumped to the city’s defense, saying that the residents all love that!

          "answer": `As a real estate professional I have witnessed first hand that the prevalence of investor purchases drives up home values in Boulder because investors are more likely to bid up and pay cash for homes than owner occupants are (especially among lower priced homes and condos).  That said, each investor purchase adds rental housing to the market, and rental housing is important because home ownership is not available to everyone. A high proportion of rental housing can help preserve income diversity in our town, which has many proven economic and social benefits. On the flip side, renters are more likely to over pay per month for housing.  When a person purchases a home with a loan, the lender ensures that they do not pay more than 30% of their income on the mortgage.  This requirement does not exist for renters, so they often pay well above 30% on housing which then has a negative effect on our economy in other areas.  When someone pays more than 30% of their income on rent, spending in every other area (food, health care, shopping, entrepreneurship) goes down. Bottom line: An abundance of rental housing has a mixed impact on the Boulder economy, especially when rental prices are high.`

Also, housing CU students is a significant boost to our local economy and is supported by numerous studies of the economic impact of CU in Boulder. Although Boulder’s detached home prices have risen to record levels, greater than $1 million on average, rentals have been relatively more affordable recently.

Because of the excess capacity we have in our larger homes in Boulder, we need to look at options which allow a more reasonable level of occupancy by unrelated people while regulating the impacts on neighborhoods (like traffic, noise, and parking).

So, one of my suggestions would be to make the program, the forms, and the process easier to understand. I think that the Energy Advisor is a nice feature.  It helps to have a real person to guide one through the process.</p>
          <p>I would recommend possibly creating special assistance funding, if the cost of compliance is an issue for owners of limited income. Another suggestion would be to expand the list of City-trained Smart Regs certified contractors.  Because something that may happen is that in 2018, as the deadline nears, it may be difficult to find contractors to do the Smart Regs work.</p>
          <p>I would actually seek to create a win-win-win, between the City, property owners, and tenants.  Because Smart Regs is important for tenants, too. The program increases the comfort and safety of tenants as well, and creates lower energy bills. If I am elected, I will seek to get out ahead of this pending situation as much as possible, and convene a working group early on – of City staff, Smart Regs contractors, and property owners who are experiencing difficulties.</p>
          <p>Taking a suggestion from the newly-released citizens Public Participation Working Group: the first step is defining the problem.  It would help to understand what, specifically, are the complexities of compliance in older properties. Once we understand the issues, we can come up with solutions to directly address the issues.</p>`

          "answer": `There are many rental properties that need significant improvements, particularly as we look at issues related to energy efficiency and how Boulder can meet its Climate Commitments. I believe these improvements are in our long-term interests to meeting these targets. However, I recognize that this can create substantial pressure on property owners to make costly improvements or tear down and rebuild altogether, which could result in even higher housing prices and make our town even less affordable. I would like to work closely with developers and property owners to explore loans for energy efficiency improvements to help offset these costs, as well as other programs that are mutually supportive.`

          "answer": `Yes, I was on the Planning Board when these regulations were passed.   There are two paths to compliance: prescriptive and performance.  To pass under the performance path requires a Home Energy Rating System (HERS) score of 120.   To pass under prescriptive path involves a checklist. The checklist relies on trained inspectors. To meet the requirements, each unit must achieve 100 checklist points in addition to two mandatory points in water conservation.  Ninety-eight percent of SmartRegs property owners choose the prescriptive path to achieve compliance. As of June 30, 2017, 92% of rental units have been inspected,78% have been deemed compliant and 18% deemed compliant by way of exemption of the total 20,000 unit goal.   When January 1, 2019 arrives, the city will have ample data about what can and can’t be done to achieve compliance. If re-elected I will work with staff to make sure that for those units that have difficulty complying, there is a path for obtaining a rental license that considers exceptional complexities and compliance is achieved in a manner that works for both the city and the property owner.`

          "answer": `I’d like to see a group come together to review noise, trash and other ordinances and processes and make recommendations on improvements. Let me give you an example. I live on the Hill. Across the street and down a few houses is a known “party” house. Last year, at the beginning of the year, they were playing loud music at 10 pm. I marched over there and asked them to quiet down, explaining that it is a neighborhood. They looked at me with shocked dismay. The idea had never occurred to the dudes!! Then, a policewoman came to the door, called by a different neighbor. I waited for her to deliver her warnings, and then I asked her what would happen next. Basically, she said nothing, unless there was another call that night. Meanwhile, the landlord was sleeping away in California, blissfully unaware of any problems. This same house continued to cause problems; I went over once more to discuss it with them, but the third time I was afraid for my safety. Net/net…as a neighbor, it is exasperating. As a Council member, I have had the intention of reviewing all of this with code enforcement, but I haven’t had time. It would be great to have your involvement in stepping up to solve the problem. I realize there are good property managers who sometimes feel out of the loop until it’s too late. So, my recommendation is to have 2 BARHA reps, 2 neighborhood reps, and City staff review all the current processes and make recommendations.`

I think that continuing to engage with the City through advocacy and education is important.  BARHA could also take a more active role in the conversation around affordable housing by working to be part of the solution to our affordability problem.  AirBNB has launched a program for disaster relief housing (https://www.airbnb.com/disaster-response) and I think that there is an opportunity for a platform like that in Boulder but for affordable or transitional housing. I began working on an idea a while ago to connect rental home owners with those in need. You can see a rough outline here: https://www.beyondshelter.live/  (you can have this if there is any interest!).  While this is a social venture, I think that it is also a way to begin working with the City and non-profits in a collaborative manner.  Establishing a relationship with the City that works towards affordable housing solutions may increase BARHA’s voice and relevance beyond the significant role the BARHA organization already occupies.`

Both businesses and community residents are have a stake in ensuring we are a diverse and inclusive city and economy. I think there are a number of opportunities to expand our access to rental housing in the city — a good example being the ability to allow homeowners to provide an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU), which could be a win / win / win for our community. ADUs can be a win for homeowners to generate additional income on their land, a win for renters providing additional options to rent a small unit or an entire home, and a win for the city tax base by providing incremental additional property taxes without much additional investment in services required. Other opportunities like cooperative housing or co-housing models can help increase access to housing while minimizing the need to build additional structures. I’m looking for solutions that benefit both the public and private interests rather than taking a zero-sum approach.`

This will give the city, BARHA and residents a chance to focus on areas that are in the mutual interest of the community. It is critically important that we look at solutions to provide real affordability. With the prohibition on rent control, we need to look at creative solutions that maintain affordability. Since the city can’t require affordable housing units on site with a rental development (states prohibition on rent control), the city should look to incentivize those that do.`

          <p>A specific area of collaboration I see has already been touched on in this questionnaire– working together on the Smart Regs program to help Boulder reach its Climate Action Goals and reduce emissions and energy consumption from buildings.</p>
          <p>Another area of collaboration is figuring out ways to maintain affordability in Boulder. I think with our existing rental stock, what this means is maintaining housing that is currently affordable in Boulder. If property owners have a property that is relatively affordable, to the extent possible, it would serve the greater cause of affordability to keep that property at the approximate rental range that it’s in, as opposed to re-building it as something much more lavish and expensive.</p>
          <p>A third area of collaboration that occurs to me is to continue the great work that BARHA has done thus far in nuisance abatement. It’s important to make sure that all rental property owners (and their tenants) are aware of the laws surrounding snow shoveling, cutting overgrown weeds and tree limbs, noise, trash and recycling, etc.</p>
          <p>A fourth area of collaboration is encouraging all rentals within Boulder to maintain current licenses with the City, or to come into licensure if they’re not.</p>
          <p>I view BARHA as a great partner to the City. If elected, I will work to strengthen this relationship. Thank you for the opportunity for me to answer your questions, and I hope to have your support in the fall.</p>

As a member of the Boulder Chamber’s Community Affairs Council, I work closely with more than three dozen civic and business leaders to thoughtfully address issues that impact our economic health, ranging from topics as diverse as community development, energy, environment, and the workforce. In this work, I recognize the need to actively engage our entrepreneurial community, especially when these relations are predicated on common cause to address housing and transportation issues. Through creative initiatives, partnerships, cross-industry mentoring, and other formats that can leverage some of Boulder’s best and brightest minds, I believe there are numerous ways to foster greater trust and improved working relations.
