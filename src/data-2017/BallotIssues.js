    Boulder County ballot issue 1A, Worthy Cause, is a 15-year
extension of a .05% sales tax that has been in place since it
was approved by voters in 2000. This small sales tax, which
amounts to only 5 cents on every $100 spent in Boulder
County, adds up to make a significant impact for low-income
residents in need through health and mental health care,
senior services, housing, childcare, youth programs and other
human services delivered by Boulder County non-profits. The
funding supports non-profit capital projects that increase the
quantity and quality of services provided.

In the face of federal and state changes to programs that
serve our neighbors in need, Worthy Cause is more important
than ever. This extension will help ensure the availability of
quality human services, for those in need, within our
community into the future. Health care access remains
uncertain, the costs of housing and childcare in the County
continue to rise, homelessness remains an ongoing challenge,
and our population is aging. At the same time, the cost to
acquire and maintain capital assets for non-profit operations
in our community is also going up. This small amount of
taxpayer dollars helps mitigate the challenge of capital
project costs for non-profits in our County.

Worthy Cause is a good investment for taxpayers. A small
amount of taxpayer funding helps generate many times the
funding for non-profits through private investments, federal
grants and donations (many from outside our County) for
projects in our community. A study published by the Leeds
School of Business at the University of Colorado in 2014
found that health and human service nonprofits make a $255
million annual economic impact in Boulder County. The
capital developments supported through Worthy Cause
employ local developers, construction companies and
architects, and drive purchases of local services and goods.
Many of the individuals served by our human services nonprofits
are hired by local businesses, which strengthens our
workforce and grows our tax base. When our local nonprofits
are strong, our local economy benefits.

Over the life of Worthy Cause, more than 70 local agencies
have utilized funding to improve their programs and services
for thousands of local residents. Capital investments have
assisted with the development of mental health, health and
dental clinics, a transportation center for seniors and
individuals with disabilities, community-based centers for
employment, food and family assistance, affordable early
childhood centers, and permanently affordable and
supportive housing.

<b>Your support for ballot issue 1A Worthy Cause will help
sustain critical human services within our community
without raising taxes.</b>

    • The average residential increase for 2018 with theextension and increase would be about $2.37 per monthand for 2019 about $1.78. The tax for 2020/2022 wouldstay the same.  Commercial and industrial increases areproportional to their electric utility bill. This allows a“pay-as-you-go” approach for the detailed engineeringon the separation plan, completion of the process, andkeeping options open.
    • The tax is tiny in comparison to the cost of every homeand business putting solar on their roofs ($15,000+ perinstallation times 50,000+ homes and businesses = $750+million).
    • Boulder has done a tremendous amount in “other”programs like efficiency and solar and electrical vehiclesbut these have only decreased Boulder’s greenhouse gasemissions by about 8%; our electricity use contributesover 50% of Boulder’s greenhouse gas emissions.
    • It will be extremely difficult and expensive for the City tomeets its climate goals of 100% renewables by 2030without municipalization.
    • Municipalization allows decisions to be made locallyrather than by a for-profit corporation headquartered inanother state.
    • The costs of staying with Xcel include the very significantrate increases expected in the next several yearsincluding paying off the costs of Xcel’s coal plants whichare rapidly becoming stranded assets, as well as the veryhigh legal costs to participate at the PUC for decades tocome, and energy decisions being made at the PUC in aprocess that is largely inaccessible to Boulder voters.
    • The recent decision by the Public Utilities Commissioncreates a clear path forward and very likely reducesfuture costs.
    • Municipal utilities have better reliability and lower ratesthan investor-owned utilities.
    • Other communities have been able to move to highlevels of renewable energy.
    • Renewable power is less expensive each year while theregulated-monopoly’s coal-fired power plants becomemore expensive to operate each year.
    • Colorado utilities law prevents any person or businessfrom selling power to any other (except to the regulated-monopoly electricity provider); municipal utilities and their customers are exempt from this restriction.
    • A “No” vote means losing leverage to keep Xcel movingforward and demonstrating that there is a viable path to100% renewable power for Colorado cities.
    • The tax keeps more of our energy dollars in Bouldersupporting local innovation in 21st century technologiesand stimulating local economic growth.
    • Xcel has proposed, but not committed to, movingforward with more renewable energy.
    • Boulder customers are roughly 4% of Xcel’s Coloradosystem and will pay Xcel:$40,000,000 for Xcel’s billion-dollar in the Comanche3 coal plant, finished less than 10 years ago, andwhich will run for another 50+ years;$16,000,000 toward Xcel’s $400 millionrefurbishment of some of Xcel’s coal plants underthe CleanAirCleanJobs Act, which Xcel pushedthrough in 2010;$24,000,000 for Xcel’s new meters, approved justmonths ago, that are already out of date becausethey cannot handle on-site solar, storage, or demandmanagement; and10% return (approx.) on Xcel’s billions of dollars ofinvested equity, on which they have essential zerorisk.

    These projects are greatlyneeded and benefit a broad cross-section of
    the community. Funds from 2M will help:
    • Safety - accelerate emergency response by movingFire Station #3 out of the
    floodplain and upgradingpolice radio communication systems; improve flood
    safety, emergency access and bike and pedestrian safety near Crestview
    Elementary by replacing aging bridges and improving Fourmile Canyon Creek
    greenway connections;
    • Community - increase access to healthy food in ourcommunity by moving
    Meals on Wheels of Boulderto a larger new facility and adding education and
    outreach capacity with a new Pollinator Pavilion forGrowing Gardens; make
    biking more broadlyaccessible with a new Community Cycles center at Boulder
    Junction; expand recycling & reuse at theCenter for ReSource Conservation;
    create a betterplace for all to play and exercise with a new and improved
    Scott Carpenter pool and recreation facilities; and
    • Culture - ensure an informed and engaged public through a complete North
    Boulder Library Branchand expansion of KGNU community radio facilities; keep
    Boulder vibrant and interesting withinvestments in public art and
    improvements at theBoulder Museum of Contemporary Art; create a Studio Arts
    education center that is affordable andopen to all members of the community.

    2M does not increase taxes, it simply extends a small portion of the
    existing sales tax to make much-neededinvestments in our community.
    In 2014, voters approveda three-year tax of three cents on a ten dollar
    purchase for capital investments in community, culture and safety projects.
    The revenue funded improvements toUniversity Hill, Chautauqua, the Dairy
    Arts Center, the Museum of Boulder and the Civic Center that have amplified
    Boulder’s cultural vibrancy, improved our quality of life, and enhanced
    economic vitality.  2Mextends this small tax through 2021 to fund capital
    investments in safety services, cultural amenities and community facilities.

    2M is a wise investment in our community.  A twelve-person citizen advisory
    committee and Boulder City Council vetted the project package in an open
    public process.  The city has a proven track record of delivering on its
    voter-approved capital improvement projects andthe non-profit organizations
    receiving assistance mustraise matching funds and meet rigorous criteria
    before funds will be released.`
